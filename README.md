# HOLYGIT
So I finally got my credential helper to work in cygwin.
Turns out I never actually installed it on windows. I
just downloaded and unzipped, and copied over the extracted
files that cygwin needed into the right directory, but never
actually installed the software on my machine....Silly me.
